# PicoPlum

Fresh and tiny tool for aggregating livestream chats into a browser source

## Why?

Existing services (notably [Restream's chat](https://restream.io/chat)) are proprietary, cannot be self-hosted and come with the anxiety of wondering if they will someday start charging for their services.

If I had to give another reason, it's mostly because I can.

## How?

Run this program and use localhost:4554 as a browser source, run another program that pulls livestream chat from sources like Twitch or Youtube and POSTS to localhost:4554/relay

## Where?

Just on head over to the [releases](https://github.com/thatpix3l/picoplum/releases) section to acquire the latest executable for your platform.
