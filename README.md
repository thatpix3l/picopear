# PicoPlum

Fresh, tiny, yet powerful tool for displaying your livestream chat in your streams with _style_.

## Why?

Existing services (notably [restream's chat](https://restream.io/chat)) are proprietary, cannot be self-hosted and come with the anxiety of wondering if they will someday start charging for their services.

If I had to give another reason, it's mostly because I can.

## How?

By selfhosting both the web files, the chat multiplexer service [RelayPlum](https://github.com/thatpix3l/relayplum) and finally a service that reads in chat messages from a source (like Twitch or YouTube) and outputs to RelayPlum

## Where?

Just head over to the [releases](https://github.com/thatpix3l/picoplum/releases) section to acquire the latest zip.
