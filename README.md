# PicoPear

üçêFresh, tiny tool for merging your livestream chats into a single browser source.

## Why?

Existing services (notably [Restream's chat](https://restream.io/chat)) are proprietary and cannot be self-hosted.

If you're looking for another reason: because I can.

## How?

Run this cli program and use localhost:4554 as a browser source, run another program that pulls livestream chat from a source and POSTS to localhost:4554/relay (like [twitching](https://github.com/thatpix3l/twitching) for Twitch chat).

## Where?

Just head on over to the [releases](https://github.com/thatpix3l/picoplum/releases) section and acquire the latest executable for your platform.
